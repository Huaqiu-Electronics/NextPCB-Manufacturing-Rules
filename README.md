# NextPCB-Manufacturing-Rules
Design Rule (DRC) resources for various EDA tools to use with HQ NextPCB's PCB manufacturing services.

This repository will be used to store design rule check (DRC) files to assist designers in meeting NextPCB's specifications and capabilities when designing their boards. By using these files, you can better ensure your designs are optimized for NextPCB's processes and capabilities, avoiding complications and additional production costs.

We have compiled these files to best match our standard operating procedures and manufacturing best practices where possible. However, since the effectiveness of the design rule checks is dictated by the capabilities of the EDA tool, using these files does not guarantee an error-free design.

We will be updating and adding resources for more EDA tools in the near future.

DRC file not available for your EDA tool? NextPCB capabilities can be found here: https://www.nextpcb.com/pcb-capabilities

Alternatively, download HQDFM, the free PCB design analysis tool by HQ Electronics for a universal check of your PCB production files and many other manufacturing-related issues.

We strongly suggest using HQDFM to review your design in addition to EDA design rule checks. With HQDFM, you can view the actual production files (Gerber or ODB++) that will be used for manufacture and use HQDFM's analysis algorithms to detect many production related issues not covered by DRCs. 

HQDFM also has advanced Design for Assembly (DFA) analysis and footprint checking capabilities for over 6 million parts and growing, as well as other useful production tools such as the panelization tool and impedance calculator.
